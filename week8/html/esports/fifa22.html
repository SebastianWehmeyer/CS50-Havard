                    Lets start with the FIFA eClub Series 2022 Pre-Qualification which took place on 2nd/3rd December 2021. As you can see, one round had three games where we needed two wins 
                    to win that round. We didn't play our first game because the opponents weren't playing. In our second game, we won against 1. FC K√∂ln Academy. After that, we lost to Unterhaching eSports and went to the loser bracket. 
                    <br>
                    Now we had to win every round to survive the Pre-Qualififation. We won two rounds in a row against HG eSports and FCN eSports and had the final decider against ECF A-TEAM. 
                    In the end, my mate Phil lost his game and I won my game. One of us had to play the last game. In the rounds before, Phil played every decider match but now I had to because he
                    couldn't handle the connection at all. Unfortunately, I conceded the decisive goal in the last minute. Nowadays with some more experience, I would've played the last minutes differently.

                    Lets move on with my first FIFA Global Series Qualifier ever. I qualified for it in December but it took place in February. The qualification for qualifiers are always tough and 
                    can cost some nerves. There were four of these qualifiers in that season and I managed to qualify for one. 
                    <br>
                    In the end, I was eliminated after four rounds because I had 3 loses. On the left, you can my opponents and the results in a Best of 2 format.
                    The good thing, on different days, I could have won more rounds against the same people because all games were close on that day. However, I gained experience which is always good.

                    The last major tournament, we had to play, was the DFB ePokal. We qualified for the "Final Day of Qualifiers" and were one win away from being in the top 32 and in the main finals.
                    Unfortunately, like all the other tournaments, we had the last round curse. We couldn't win other last rounds and so we didn't win this one against TSV Nordhastedt as well. Of course, it was a draw after two games,
                    so there was a decider match.

                    If you read <a class="text-link-normal" href="../esports/general.html">General</a>, you noticed that I had to leave Wacker Gaming because of financial problems. Because of that,
                    I had to look for a new one and played some academy tournaments. One was for Borussia M√∂nchengladbach eSports where I didn't play well and one was for Werder Bremen eSports. 
                    <br>
                    In Bremen, I played very well and won the 1vs1 tournament. If you think, they had to take me because of this, you are wrong. There were different options because they
                    don't look only at your skill level. E.g., you have to fit to the club. This was just one example but there are some more. The whole package just has to fit.
                    <br>
                    In the end, they took two different players. Life is life and life can be hard sometimes. And that's why I went as a Free Agent into FIFA 23.
